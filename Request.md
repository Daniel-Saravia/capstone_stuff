Why is Each Item Needed?
------------------------

150W LED Moving Head Light:
This serves as the foundation for the Mini C-RAM project, functioning as the core hardware for real-time drone detection, tracking, and targeting. Equipped with DMX (Digital Multiplex) control, the moving head light enables precise and dynamic movement, ideal for targeting drones. The built-in lens can be replaced with a custom 3D-printed GoPro mount, allowing integration of a GoPro Hero 5 camera for wide-angle coverage. Connected to a computer running OpenCV, it facilitates real-time drone detection and tracking. Additionally, a drone buster is incorporated for signal jamming and safe, non-kinetic mitigation. The combination of the moving head light, advanced algorithms, and mitigation device creates a comprehensive system for drone surveillance and intervention.

Enttec Open DMX USB 70303 Lighting Interface:
This device is essential for controlling the DMX-enabled moving head light from a computer. It translates computer commands into DMX signals, enabling precise, automated light movement to track and target drones. It integrates seamlessly with OpenCV software, allowing real-time light adjustments based on drone movements.

Amazon Basics USB-A to USB-B 2.0 Printer Cable:
This cable connects the Enttec Open DMX USB interface to a computer, providing a stable and reliable data link. Its 10-foot length offers flexibility in setup, ensuring seamless communication between the software and DMX interface for uninterrupted system operation.
